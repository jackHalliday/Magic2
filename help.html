<p>
Welcome to Magic2, the successor to Magic. The software has been written by
Jakub Dranczewski during his UROP in 2018. It's main purpose is to create plasma
density maps based on traced out interferograms.
</p>

<h2 id="h2_basics">Basics of the interface</h2>
<h3 id="h3_graphing_area">The graphing area</h3>
<p>
The main element of Magic2 is the graphing area which takes up most of the
screen. The output of all functions will be displayed here, it also allows
interactivity in certain modes.
</p>
<h3 id="h3_sidebar">The sidebar</h3>
<p>
The sidebar consists of two sections. The top one (Display) can be used to
change what is currently displayed in the <a href="#h3_graphing_area">graphing
area</a>. Clicking any of the options shows the corresponding graph, or
attempts to obtain it (while asking the user for permission). For example, if
no file is open, clicking "Background fringes" will result in a dialog allowing
for choosing a file to open and display. Right-clicking the options allows for
recalculating them (for example right-clicking the "Subtracted map" will
recalculate the subtracted map). There are also two buttons for changing the
thickness of the fringe rendering.
</p>
<p>
The bottom section allows for changing the fringe <a>labelling mode</a>, so that
the phase goes up, down, or stays constant. It can also be reset to zero.
</p>
<h3 id="h3_menu">The menu</h3>
<p>
The menu contains some additional options you may want to use, although <a
href="#h3_sidebar">the sidebar</a> can be used to go through pretty much the
whole fringe loading, labelling, interpolating and subtracting process. The
options that can be found in the menus will be discussed in different section
below.
